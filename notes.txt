# Add finalrecon to subenum.sh

# Fix hakrawler (Maybe does not need fixing?)
Works fine

# Fix $DOMAIN.txt file saved in current dir of the program (+)
Issue is because of findomain tool!

# Httpx adds protocol to subdomains and when live checking is over,
# it adds protocol://domain to live.txt files
Fixed

# Check dnsx (if it puts things to live.txt) because in 
# m10payments.com example it was putting things like 
# keyclock.m10payments.com to live.txt
Remove dnsx from live check and put dnsx after ffuf before live check
